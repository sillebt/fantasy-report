## Dynasty Insanity Preseason Almanac (Forward by Andy Reid)

![The Chef](img/andy.png){width=50%}

This is America, gentlemen. You play to win. If it is ping-pong or a hot dog eating contest, you play to win. That is how you go about this business we call Dynasty Fantasy Football. It is all about getting that sweet, sweet taste of victory.

Maybe you won last year. Maybe you didn't deserve to, either. Doesn't matter to me. **If you like chocolate cake and you eat a piece, and then you have one dangling in front of your face, you're going to want to eat that too.** And hungry dogs run faster. 

This isn't gonna be easy but its gonna be worth it. Building a dynasty team, cultivating these players, it's a lot like a great hamburger.It’s hard, I mean, you have to execute that thing the right way. You have to get it to where it’s perfect and juicy where you cut it open but it's not raw. Then a nice slice of a Vidalia onion, some mayo, ketchup, a little squirt of mustard but not too much, pickles, lettuce and tomato and, baby, I’m ready to roll. 

To put all that together and make it perfect, there’s some time involved. That’s where it comes in. **You practice, you get it right and then when you bite into it baby, hoo boy, it’s ecstasy right there, so that’s why we play.** There isn't a man alive who doesn't love a good hamburger and a hit of ectasy in my book. 

There's a lot of ways to win in this league. Sometimes you want to keep the roster young. And at the same time you need those veterans who are older. It’s a delicate blend, kind of like sweet and sour pork. 

So go attack this thing, boys. Attack it like I went after a few chile rellenos last night. Because if you have that trophy, that's a special feeling. It means it all paid off and it'll matter to you forever. When you sit back and look at that hunk of metal, it'll bring a smile to your face. **It's like a Snickers bar in the freezer, right? I mean, it's treasured.**

## The Final Rosters

It's almost Week 1 and these are the final rosters each Franchise has selected, by choice or not, to take the field. 

Anyone of you can build plausible-sounding, 'fact-based' narratives that attempt to explain why your roster is taking home the trophy. Only time will tell and, hopefully, 2023 doesn't end with another tainted, asterisk-bound title & require a near death on live TV for Tommy Tsao to claim a championship. This may be the only thing we're all in agreement on.

To preview, the following information is aggregated for each team: 

1. 2023 Pre-Draft Roster

2. 2022 Final Roster (Ranked by Fantasy Points Scored)

3. 2022 Final Schedule Results 

4. Career Head to Head Records vs Each Opponent (2022-23)
